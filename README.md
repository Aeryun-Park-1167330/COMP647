# Supplement Recommendation System
*COMP647 â€“ Machine Learning Project*
Machine Learning Classification Model for Health-Based Product Suggestions

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning classification system that recommends supplement categories based on health and lifestyle data. Using a dataset of 1,000 individuals with comprehensive health metrics, the model predicts suitable supplement categories: Cardiovascular Health, Joint Health, and Digestive Health.

Note: This is an educational project for machine learning practice. The supplement categories are fictional mappings and not actual medical recommendations.

## Dataset Analysis
Data Source: Diet Recommendations Dataset (Kaggle)
Sample Size: 1,000 individuals
Features: 21 health and lifestyle variables including age, BMI, disease type, physical activity, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by Korure, a New Zealand-based health supplement brand, to explore how AI can enhance personalized wellness recommendations in the supplement industry.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only and does not provide real medical recommendations. The supplement recommendations are based on fictional mappings and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult healthcare professionals for supplement and health decisions.
